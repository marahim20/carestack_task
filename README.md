**Mini Social Network Project**

_This is a project for a mini social network, built using React and some useful libraries. The goal of this project is to create a platform where users can sign up, search for other users, view their profiles, and add or remove them as friends._

**Tech Stack**

To get started, we created a _Next.js app_, which makes it easy to set up a React-based project with server-side rendering capabilities. We also used a few libraries to help with the styling and state management of our app:

**Tailwind CSS**: This is a popular CSS utility library that makes it easy to create responsive and customizable UI components. We used it to style our button and input field components, among other things.

**React Icons**: This is a library that provides a wide variety of popular icons that can be easily added to a React project. We used it to add some icons to our app, such as a lock icon for the login modal.

**Zustand**: This is a state management library that allows for easy sharing of state across components in a React project. We used it to manage the state of our login modal and input field components.

**Prisma**: This is a modern database toolkit that allows developers to easily access databases through a type-safe and queryable API. It provides an abstraction layer on top of the database, allowing for faster and more efficient database access. With Prisma, developers can write database queries in a declarative way and take advantage of powerful features like migrations and schema management.

**bcrypt**: This is a password-hashing function that allows developers to store passwords securely in a database. It uses a computationally intensive algorithm to hash passwords, making them difficult to crack or guess. bcrypt is widely used in web applications and is considered a best practice for password storage.

**NextAuth**: This is a library that provides easy authentication for Next.js applications. It supports multiple authentication providers, such as OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and passwordless authentication. NextAuth allows developers to add authentication to their applications with just a few lines of code, while still providing advanced features like session management and access control.

**SWR**: ("stale-while-revalidate") This is a React Hooks library that makes it easy to fetch data from a remote API and keep it up to date in the user interface. It does this by caching responses from the API and revalidating them in the background. This allows for faster page loads and smoother user experiences, as well as better performance and fewer unnecessary network requests.

**Axios**: This is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from web applications. It provides an easy-to-use API for sending asynchronous HTTP requests to a server and handling the response. Axios supports a wide range of features, such as request and response interception, automatic serialization and deserialization of JSON data, and the ability to cancel requests.

**React Spinners**: This is a collection of loading spinner animations built for React applications. It provides a set of pre-built loading spinners that can be easily integrated into any React project. These spinners are highly customizable and can be adjusted to match the branding and styling of the application.

**React Dropzone**: This is a React library that provides an easy-to-use drag-and-drop file upload component for web applications. It simplifies the process of uploading files by allowing users to drag and drop files from their computer directly into the web application.
