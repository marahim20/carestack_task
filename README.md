**Mini Social Network Project**

This is a project for a mini social network, built using React and some useful libraries. The goal of this project is to create a platform where users can sign up, search for other users, view their profiles, and add or remove them as friends.

**Tech Stack**

To get started, we created a *Next.js app*, which makes it easy to set up a React-based project with server-side rendering capabilities. We also used a few libraries to help with the styling and state management of our app:

**Tailwind CSS**: This is a popular CSS utility library that makes it easy to create responsive and customizable UI components. We used it to style our button and input field components, among other things.

**React Icons**: This is a library that provides a wide variety of popular icons that can be easily added to a React project. We used it to add some icons to our app, such as a lock icon for the login modal.

**Zustand**: This is a state management library that allows for easy sharing of state across components in a React project. We used it to manage the state of our login modal and input field components.
